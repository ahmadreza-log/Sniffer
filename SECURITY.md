## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** open a public issue.
2. Contact the maintainers privately (e.g. via GitHub private message or contact via [Email](mailto:ahmadreza.log@gmail.com)).
3. Describe the issue and steps to reproduce.
4. Allow time for a fix before any public disclosure.

We will acknowledge your report and work on a fix when applicable. Thank you for helping keep this project safe.
